## Isekai Castle Crusaders

### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever imagined yourself in a fantasy world of kingdoms and castles, lairs and dominions? And how about traveling in a party where you can meet interesting characters and develop relationships with them? Introducing Isekai Castle Crusaders. In this game, you’re spawned into a country oppressed by the lords of the kingdom. Moved by the pleas of the local citizens, you set forth on a mission to defeat the evil tyrant king. You’ll meet a cast of interesting characters who will aid you throughout your journey. You may even have the chance to flourish your connections with them!

### Synopsis
Playing Isekai Castle Crusaders is like playing any classic tower defense game–except instead of building towers to defend your base, you’ll be battling to relinquish the lands of the kingdom! You’ll spawn in minions to help you destroy enemy structures, fight together with your comrades to take down the enemy base, and venture into the capital to restore the country to its former glory! The time is now, comrades. Fight together as one!!!

#### Objective
To defeat the tyrant ruling over the kingdom of Cornucopia. In each level, the player must destroy one of the kingdom's bases to advance to the next level.

#### Description of Mechanics
Because the view of the map is tied to the avatar the player is controlling, players must use the WASD or arrow keys to move the camera around. Players can spawn in minions based on their current morale. Both the player and minions have HP; once their HP drops to zero, that entity dies and can no longer participate in battle.

The kingdom has placed many towers across each of the maps the player will come across. These towers must be sieged to open up the part of the map they block.
