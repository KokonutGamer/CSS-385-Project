### Feedback from Game Testers

#### Alan Cordova
1. A female character
2. The minion killed the tower AI all by themselves and I just watched
3. OP, minion took a direct shot and lived
4. No
5. No

#### Andy Vu
1. Since there is a melee minion, something I would wanna see is a ranged minion such as archer or mage.
2. The tower aiming feels static and doesn't change projectile direction. The minion AI looks and feels good.
3. In my opinion, the minion is way too overpowered. Just wouldn't die to the tower and the tower gets 3 shot by minions.
4. For right now not really because there is only one type of minion. If more unique minions are added, I could imagine this could change different play styles by a lot more.
5. It feels okay, just the minions need to be nerfed and tower needs to be buffed.

#### Kent Mayoya
1. A tank. Moves slower, but has greater health and can inflict more damage.
2. Tower AI is unfinished as it does not aim yet. Minion AI looks good so far. Accurately moves towards the tower. However, when there are a lot of minions, they can block each other from attacking the tower.
3. The minion speed and tower fire rate seems reasonable. However, it’s hard to tell until health and damage is implemented.
4. Yes, once the game is more polished to include actual gameplay.
5. Currently it does not, as I did not have to press anything to win.

### Summary of Findings
Currently, Isekai Castle Crusaders is very limited in terms of gameplay. Play testers don't feel a sense of reward, nor do they feel like they have control over their gameplay. One of the biggest factors to this is the AI for both minions and towers. Towers do not target minions properly, and their bullets deal no damage to minions. Meanwhile, minions can solo the level while the player sits on the sideline.
