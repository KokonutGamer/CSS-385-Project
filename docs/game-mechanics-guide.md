## Game Mechanics Guide

From the title screen, players must set control configurations via the settings button on the right side of the screen. After configuring controls, players can navigate back to the title screen and enter the test level by pressing start.

### Current Game Mechanics
Players can control their hero by using the control configuration set in the settings page. The goal is to destroy the target base on the map.

Players can spawn troops to attack towers using the HUD button on the bottom right corner. For now, this only spawns a sword fighter. Sword fighters target the base on the map and attack from melee range.

Once the base's health is depleted, players will be sent to the victory screen which will in turn provide navigation back to the title screen.
