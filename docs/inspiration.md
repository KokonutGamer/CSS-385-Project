## Key Inspirations

Throughout my life, I've been inspired from several different types of games. In this document, I'll discuss the genres and key inspirations from each genre I want to draw inspiration from.

### Platformers (2D and 3D)
The oldest games I remember playing as a child can be categorized as platformers. This genre encompasses a wide range of sub-genres, but the most notable classics I remember were New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Kirby's Return to Dreamland, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. 

Super Smash Bros. Brawl can fall into an even more specific branch - 2D platform fighters. Because of my experience playing platformers, transitioning to platform fighters always felt natural to me. Other notable platform fighters I take inspiration from are Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Rivals of Aether.

Modern day platformers can also encompass other genres. For example, the metroidvania series of the decade, Hollow Knight, is one of the most iconic from the indie scene. I especially love how Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong implement movement, combat, customization, etc., and I may lean into some of its notable game design principles, such as world keys.

### RPGs
Role-playing games have also been a huge inspiration for me growing up. Titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess or The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword really immersed me into its gameplay. Roaming around a huge map as Link, finding new tools and defeating enemies... the experience really enthralled me.

RPGs also encompass a variety of selections. Take Stardew Valley for example - this game is also considered an RPG, but so is a game like Nier: Automata. I absolutely adore both of these games, too; in Stardew Valley, I can plant whatever crops I want, earn income through several different methods, and explore the town and other regions; in Nier: Automata, I find the combat to be very engaging, and immersing myself into the story really paid out at the end of the game.

Now, there's a certain genre of video games that often falls under RPGs that don't get the best reputations: gacha games. I'll admit, I play these occasionally (though I used to be more of a hardcore fan over a year ago). Ignoring the gacha aspect, most gacha games also have engaging stories and worlds like other RPGs. I do think monetization is a huge issue in the industry overall, but as a consumer, it's up to be responsible for our own money.

### Strategy
The final genre I want to touch inspiration from are strategy games. A simple game like rock-paper-scissors can include some strategy to it. Personally, I want to take ideas from chess and the Bloons Tower Defense series. For chess, I enjoy building pattern recognition, game sense, and puzzle solving skills. I feel that, for being a really simple game, it has some of the most complex situations you can encounter despite the rise of chess bots. And for Bloons Tower Defense (and tower defense games in general), having to manage income, understand tower cross-path advantages and disadvantages, tower placement, ability timings and balloon weaknesses... all of this really gives the player agency into strategies they want to lean to while maintaining a sense of strategy.

### Final Thoughts
All of these games (and possibly more I haven't mentioned) are games I want to take inspiration. I don't believe I can implement everything I've mentioned, but I'll try to take one thing from each genre I really like and implement it into the game I want to make.
